# Smart-Irrigation-System
The key objective of the project is to monitor the soilâ€™s moisture content with the aid of a moisture sensor circuit, and irrigate it based on its nature using a Arduino UNO, NodeMCU, YL-69 and an automatic water inlet setup which can also monitor and record soil moisture which is constantly modified using mobile application and can be controlled in future to optimize these resources so that the plant growth and yield is maximized.

A record of soil moisture in ThingSpeak database for backup. This backup directs the farmers regarding the type of crop to be cultivated in future. IOT gives the whole information to the operator about the irrigation. 

Our aim is to develop a wireless level controlled smart irrigation system to provide irrigation system which is automatic for the plants which help in saving water and money. The main objective is to apply the system for improvement of health of the soil and hence the plant via multiple sensors. 

The use of easily available components reduces the manufacturing and maintenance costs. This makes the proposed system to be an economical, appropriate and a low maintenance solution for applications, especially in rural areas and for small scale agriculturists. The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming the agriculture industry and enabling farmers to contend with the enormous challenges they face.
